    <h2>Volunteering</h2>
    <p>I volunteered in Community Building Art Works by hosting workshops and engaging in them while giving feedback to their art.
    I was involved in this organization in my spring semester of 2024 and I was able to learn on how to write creatively and creating 
    art from my own ideas.  </p>
