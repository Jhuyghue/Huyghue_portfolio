            <p>Hello! My name is Jayden Huyghue, and I am a Information Technology major at Kennesaw State University.
                I am from Ellenwood, Georgia who has a huge interest in computers and anything art related. I was always
                curious about how things worked, often taking apart electronics I have at home to understand their workings.
                This passion led me to pursue a major in Information Technology at Kennesaw State University, where Iâ€™ve had 
                the opportunity to expand my knowledge in programming and software development. My academic journey has been
                a rewarding experience that has laid a solid foundation for my future career in technology.
            </p>

            <p>During my time at KSU, I have been involved in STEM related clubs and doing campus activies to give myself
                a break from studies. The most thing on campus that I'm currently engaged in is the Close-Knit Club and the 
                Aerial Robotics Competition Team. I have learned how to use industry standard tools like Solidworks and Microsoft Excel. This hands-on 
                experience in the industry gave me insight into how to model and calculating date for aircrafts.
                I'm currently involved in a game programming project in my CSE 1321 lecture class and I've gained on how to program a racing based
                game in Python. I still have a great time at this university since I get to learn new concepts and have fun while researching about them.  </p>
            <hr>
            <p>My primary goal is to contribute to the evolving field of cybersecurity. With the rise of cyber threats 
                and the growing importance of data protection, I am passionate about creating secure systems that safeguard
                sensitive information. I aim to specialize in areas like ethical hacking, network security, and incident 
                response, helping organizations prevent breaches and recover from cyberattacks. I am also interested in 
                pursuing certifications or finding interships so that I can have the skill to apply it in real work setting.
                I hope to work for a leading cybersecurity firm or in the IT security department of a organization, 
                where I can protect assets and mentor others in maintaining good security practices.
